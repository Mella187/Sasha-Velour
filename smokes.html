        Smoke & Mirrors, Sasha Velour's first one-queen theatre tour, is an effortless blend of drag, visual art, and magic.
        Velour introduces audiences to a whole new side of her artistry, through 13 dazzling and
        genre-busting lip-synch performances, all directed and choreographed by the queen herself.
        Youâ€™ll be on the edge of your seat as she explodes into rose petals, vanishes in a poof of smoke,
        saws herself in half, conjures a rainstorm, even transforms into a tree in front of your eyes (to name just a few).
        But the real magic is the way that these illusions and deceptions serve to unmask deeper truths, sparking fresh analysis of gender,
        fame, family, and the importance of dreaming big and living life over-the-top. </p>
