        <p class="text-about"> Sasha Velour is a gender-fluid drag queen and visual artist. Through multi-media performance, advocacy, and design,
          Velour’s work maps out new frontiers for drag and creates new spaces for LGBTQ artists to flourish and thrive.
          Velour came to national attention in 2017, when she won season 9 of the Emmy-winning reality TV competition RuPaul's Drag Race.<br>
          Velour invested her Drag Race prize money back into “Nightgowns,” the monthly drag show she had been producing since 2015 in Brooklyn.
          Serving as its host, director, and in-house lighting designer, Velour has turned Nightgowns into one of the most esteemed live drag shows
           in the world, dubbed “[the] thinking queens drag show” by Time Out NY and “eclectic, wild and highly personal” by Billboard Magazine.<br>
           Nightgowns has been produced in New York, London, and Los Angeles. The monthly appearance at National Sawdust in Brooklyn continues to
           sell out within minutes, exposing thousands of fans to forms of drag not seen on TV.<br>
          Velour frequently uses her platform to discuss politics, queer history, and LGBTQ+ issues. She was billed as a keynote speaker
          at the 2018 Teen Vogue Summit in New York City. In December 2018,
          she took the stage at The Smithsonian for “The Long Conversation,” an event with thought leaders from around the world.
