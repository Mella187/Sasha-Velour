      <p>All three volumes of her critically-acclaimed magazine, Velour: The Drag Magazine (House of Velour, 2015-2017) have been
        collected as a hardcover coffee table book, Velour: The Drag Magazine [Collector’s Edition].
        At 296 pages, entirely ad-free, Velour: The Drag Magazine [Collector’s Edition] is as much an art book as it is a magazine.
        It is designed from cover to cover by Velour herself, in her unique style, and features illustrations, collages, fashion editorials, poems,
        interviews,
        and essays by over 75 queer artists and drag performers from around the world. Since its inception, the magazine has been dedicated to
        showcasing the work of drag queens and drag kings, queer, trans, AFAB (assigned female at birth), and non-binary drag artists from all
        backgrounds.
        This collection stands as a celebration of every drag artist who dares to create work that pushes boundaries in both queer and mainstream
        culture. Velour says the pieces collected in this coffee table book are as varied and valid as the drag artists they depict.
        “There is ‘no right way’ to do, or even define drag,” she insists, “We seek to celebrate it all.” </p>
